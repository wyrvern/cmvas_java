   - General function : public void db_connect () : postgresql/jdbc driver
     and basic connection settings.
   - Implementation of strFactory/stdFactory. These will only find
     valuable use in producion.
   - I intend to pick up 2 CellC sims tomorrow. I have already managed
     to intercept CellC website traffic via the Zed Proxy. I should be
     able to intercept the GET/POST replies? (This I'll deal with
     tomorrow)
   - SQL parameters, such as INSERT/SELECT/etc - I need to address this
     as soon as I have a valid reply from the CellC website.
   - "However we will need to retrieve balances for more than one SIM, 
     so your application will have to run through this process as 
     many times as necessary." -- I need clarification on this,
     although I have a few ideas as to how to implement this - given
     the use of a poll() function to pool various connections if
     necessary.
