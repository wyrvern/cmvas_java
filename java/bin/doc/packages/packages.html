<h1>Packages - A set of rules to keep your compiler and interpreter
happy
happy.</h1>

Many people in <a href="news:comp.lang.java.programmer">
comp.lang.java.programmer</a> have problems compiling when they
first enter the dizzy world of packages. There are various ways you
<b>can</b> get everything to work, and this is just one of them -
but I believe it's one of the <b>easiest</b> ways to get things to
work.
<h2>Setting the scene</h2>
<ul>
<li>
I'll assume for the moment that you're working on Windows, using a
compiler that takes the standard javac options (jikes does). If
you're on Unix, I'm sure you can work out what the equivalent would
be.<p>
</p></li><li>
Let's say you have two packages, <code>com.mycompanypackage</code>
containing classes <code>CompanyApp</code> and
<code>BusinessLogic</code>;
and <code>org.mypersonalpackages.util</code> containing classes
<code>Semaphore</code> and <code>HandyBits</code>.
<code>BusinessLogic</code> needs access to <code>HandyBits</code>
(and your boss has waived rights to your personal code so long as
you don't mind putting it in the product!)<p>
</p></li></ul>
<h2>Coding and compiling</h2>
<ul>
<li>
First things first: source organisation. You need to choose a "root"
directory for your source tree. (I'll just call this the root from
here onwards.) I'll use <code>c:\java</code> for my examples.<p>
</p></li><li>
You should have four files for your source code:
<ul>
<li><code>c:\java\com\mycompanypackage\CompanyApp.java</code>
</li><li><code>c:\java\com\mycompanypackage\BusinessLogic.java</code>
</li><li><code>c:\java\org\mypersonalpacakges\util\Semaphore.java</code>
</li><li><code>c:\java\org\mypersonalpacakges\util\HandyUtil.java</code>
</li></ul>

Note that the source files are organised in the same way as the
package structure. This is very important, as it helps to tell the
compiler where to find things - as well as making it much easier for
<b>you</b> to find your source code later on.<p>
</p></li><li>
At the top of each of your source files (before any imports or
anything else other than comments), you should have a package
declaration. For example, CompanyApp.java would start
with:
<pre>package com.mycompanypackage;</pre>
</li><li>
If your class needs to import anything from other packages, it can
do it after that. For instance, <code>BusinessLogic.java</code>
could start:
<pre>package com.mycompanypackage;
import org.mypersonalpackages.util.*;
</pre>
or possibly
<pre>package com.mycompanypackage;
import org.mypersonalpackages.util.HandyUtil;
</pre>

Some people like using import-on-demand (the first version), others
don't. To be honest, it's mainly a matter of laziness. I use
import-on-demand because I'm lazy. I realise that it could create
incompatibilities if names clash later on, but within the standard
Java packages that I use that's not likely to happen very often. (This is
partly because I don't do much GUI work. If I were using
the <code>java.awt</code> and <code>java.util</code> packages in the
same class, I'd be more careful. I'll try to keep my publicly
available source a bit cleaner though. (Don't look yet - I haven't
done the cleaning!)<p>
</p></li><li>Time to compile the classes. I usually compile everything, just
to make sure I'll get the most recent version of all classes. There
are some non-obvious dependencies in Java, such as constants from
one class being embedded in another (eg if <code>HandyUtil</code>
refers to <code>Semaphore.SOME_CONSTANT</code> which is a static
final primitive/literal String, the value will be embedded in
<code>HandyUtil.class</code>.) There are two ways you could compile
everything. Either specify it explicitly:
<pre>c:\java&gt; javac -d . com\mycompanypackage\*.java org\mypersonalpackage\util\*.java</pre>
or create a list of files and pass that to javac:
<pre>c:\java&gt; dir /s /b *.java &gt; srcfiles.txt
c:\java&gt; javac -d . @srcfiles.txt
</pre>
Note that you compile from the root directory, and you specify
<code>-d .</code> to tell the compiler to put the classes in a
package structure starting at the root too. Some people don't like
keeping class and source files together - in that case, you could
use <code>-d classes</code>, although you need to create the
<code>classes</code> directory first. (You'll also need to either
compile everything each time or put classes on the classpath for the
compiler with the <code>-classpath</code> option.) Unless you really know
what you're doing, I suggest you use the above <b>and make sure you
don't have a classpath set</b>. If you <b>must</b> use a classpath
for some reason (see <a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/java/extensions.html">my notes on the
extension mechanism</a> for ways to avoid this), make sure that
<code>.</code> (the current directory) is on the classpath.
</li></ul>
<h2>Running the application</h2>

Many people "accidentally" end up with their classes in the
right place, etc, just by luck, but then run into errors like:
<code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: MyCompanyApp (wrong name:
com/mycompanypackage/MyCompanyApp</code>. Hopefully, if you've
understood everything above, you won't run into this. It happens if
you try to run your code using something like this:
<pre>c:\java\com\mycompanypackage&gt; java MyCompanyApp</pre>
Here's how to avoid it:
<ul>
<li>Stay in your "root" directory, eg <code>c:\java</code>
</li><li>Always use the <b>fully qualified</b> classname. So, for example:
<pre>c:\java&gt; java com.mycompanypackage.MyCompanyApp</pre>
</li><li>The JVM knows to find that class file in the directory
com\mycompanypackage (note, this is a VM-specific convention, it's
just that almost all VMs use it - there's nothing in the language
specification to say that packages <b>have</b> to be stored that 
way; the VM just has to know how to find and load a class), but
there's something in the class file which says what its fully
qualified name is - and the VM uses that to check that the class its
been asked to load is actually the one it's found. That's why you
get the error above - if you can understand that error, you're a
long way towards understanding how packages work.
</li></ul>
