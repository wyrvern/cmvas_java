----------------------------------------------------------
Both the date range selection and group selection are
seperate. If you wish to send via the date selection,
ONLY the date selection tickbox must be checked.
The same applies to group selection. There is no combination
of the two.
----------------------------------------------------------
- To utilise the date-range option, check 'Send via Date',
  select the table you wish to use (ie, 'Sales, RR, etc),
  enter the dates to begin & end with.
  Remember to proceed numbers less than 10, such as 9 as 09.
  Enter the fields for Subject, from & message & send your email.
  This will send an email to all within that table between
  the dates you enetred.
----------------------------------------------------------
- to utilise the group selection option (example)
  To send to all those who have downloaded the demo,
  minus those who have bought the cd.
- Check 'Send via Group Selection'
- Select 'Downloaders' and submit '+ Group'
- Select 'Sales' and submit '- Group'
  This adds the Downloaders, removing all of those who
  have bought the CD.
- Submission of 'Duplicates' removes any duplicates between
  two tables. In this example, only Downloaders was added.
  Were you to add two tables, ie (Downloaders/Sales) you would
  be required to use this button.
- Next, Fill in 'Subject', select 'From', and enter the message
  to send. The 'To' field will be the email address of the
  recipient. I will probably remove this text box in a revision.
- Press send to send bulk mail.
