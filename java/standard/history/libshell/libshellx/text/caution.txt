 To create a JCDW object from a given memory location,
 use the com.ms.dll.DllLib.ptrToStruct( ) method.
 It takes the native memory location of the data and
 the class of the JCDW representing the structure
 stored in that location. The result is an instance
 of specified JCDW initialized with the values from
 the specified memory location. Note that the Microsoft
 VM attempts to propagate all native values into the
 new JCDW instance. As a result, if the memory location
 is simply a newly allocated block, it will contain
 uninitialized garbage-collection values. This may
 cause the Microsoft VM to fault, especially if the
 JCDW contains some pointer values that may be mapped
 into protected memory. To guard against this, ensure
 that the memory location being used in the mapping
 has been initialized.
